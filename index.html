4.  Do NOT include any introductory text, concluding text, explanations, or any other words besides the numbered list.
5.  For each question, determine the truthful answer (yes or no).

7.  If the truthful answer is NO, you MUST respond with the word: Orange
8.  If you cannot or will not answer a question, you MUST respond with the word: Refusal
